# BuyMeAChai

## Introduction

Welcome to the BuyMeAChai project! This inspiration for this project stemmed from my recent learnings around Uniswap v2 and its contracts. Eager to dive deeper into the world of smart contracts, I decided to venture into creating one of my own. Coupled with my journey into TypeScript, this project serves as an excellent learning milestone for me.

## Project Status

**BuyMeAChai** is currently a work-in-progress (WIP) and has multiple exciting features lined up for implementation. Here's what's on the horizon:

- **Fees:** A mechanism to integrate transaction fees which could be beneficial for platform maintenance or as a revenue model.
- **Factory Contract:** A design pattern that would allow the deployment of multiple instances of the primary contract, ensuring scalability and modularity.

- **UI Development:** An intuitive user interface is in the works, aimed at making the interaction seamless for users.

- **Collaborations with Influencers:** We're looking to partner with influencers. This could serve as an avenue for influencers to connect with their followers in a more personal way, allowing supporters to leave messages along with their contributions.
